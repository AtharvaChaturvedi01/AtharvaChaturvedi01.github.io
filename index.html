            <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am Atharva Chaturvedi, a recent graduate from the University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, with a degree in Computer Science (May 2023). Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in a diverse range of technologies, honing my skills in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python.</p>
            <p>Before venturing into the fascinating world of data science, I also studied database management and web development. This journey equipped me with hands-on experience in MySQL, Oracle, and Front-end PHP. I also explored the realm of game development using the Unity game engine, showcasing my adaptability in various tech domains.</p>
            <p>When it comes to handling data, I am comfortable with Microsoft Excel for basic data manipulation and analysis. I have also worked with PowerBI, turning data into easy-to-understand visualizations.</p>
